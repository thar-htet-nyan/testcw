# **Code of Ethics and General Conduct**

*This code of conduct is amended on July 6th, 2023 adopting professionalism concerning with Group 2 of B.Sc.(Hons) Computing. The Preamble is described to be able to contemplate our act throughout the project.*

## **Preamble**
Being part of the computing family, there are responsibilities and behaviours which are meant to protected and behaved. Being able to conduct professionalism is part of the soft-skills that are meant to be with any adult who are on their path of success.

## **General Ethics**
One formidable and crucial rule to hold for being part of computing is to maintain **one's** integrity. The principle states the quality of one's mindset with oneself and other contributors. One should neither act over the boundary nor disrespect others contributors' work and privacy. The skills achieved are devoted for employing benefits to the society, its member and surrounding neighbourhood.

In case of negative consequences and conflicts, most will be cleared out using majority rules to be faired enough while seeking help from lectures might become necessary. Neither unintended nor intended actions will not be spared when an error is occurred. To minimize the possibility of harms occurring, one should follow best practices and best behaviour.

Rule are seperated with levels. Level 1 rules are important but consequences of those are not as serious as that of level 2. In level 1, includes minimum  rules in order to avoid conflicts and miscommunication. As for level 2 rules which carry serious impact, penalty will be carried out in accordance with academic integrity rules established by Edinburgh Napier University.

Any *level 1* rules breaking are punished using point system which will be distributed among the group contributors at the start of each week. ***100*** marks will be handed out at the start of the week which will be later deducted on the percentage calculation of one's weekly total. As for example, if one breaks a rule which will deduct 2 points, it will calculate as the 2% of 25%, if the total contribution is 25%, and subtracted.

### **Level 1 Rule**

*Rule 1:* One should not be absent group meeting, especially every **Thursday** before deadline.

*Rule 2:* One should not be absent classes without informing team members in advance *(Do inform at least one member)*

*Rule 3:* One should not open or save others people coding with their consent and permission.

*Rule 4:* When conflict happens, the decision is made with majority rules.

### **Level 2 Rule**
*Rule 1:* Follow academic integrity *(Do not copy/paste others code)*

*Rule 2:* One should take responsibilities of one's security. If breached due to lack of cautious, one will be filed according to academic integrity.

*Rule 3:* One must complete the assigned tasks before every **Friday**
